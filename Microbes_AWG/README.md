# Microbes Analysis Working Group

The Microbes Analysis Working group is comprised of researchers focused on analyzing microbial datasets within GeneLab that includes gene-expression, proteomic, metabolomic and environmental metagenomic datasets. The group aims to establish a standard pipelines for 16S amplicon metagneome profiling datasets that will allow the public to better understand these datasets and allow more rapid reanalysis and publication. The group has also contributed to identifiy different microbiome profiling assays that could be used in combination to gain a more complete understanding of the microbial contents of the mouse gut and how this changes during spaceflight. Microbes AWG members meet regularly to share and discuss the latest developments in microbial communities.
