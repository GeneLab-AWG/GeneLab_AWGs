# Multi-omics Analysis Working Group

The Multi-omics/Systems Biology Analysis Working Group is comprised of research scientists working together with a shared goal of determining the best pipelines and analysis that can be done to relate different omics platforms that include transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and methylation data. The group has developed cross-omics analysis through a network-based tool, and started visualization capabilities and participation with the GeneLab Visualization Working Group. The group's several projects have resulted in publications throughout the years, where they studied topics like mitochondrial stress and radiation driving spaceflight health risks by using transcriptomic and proteomic data. Muti-omics AWG members meet regularly to share and discuss the latest developments in space biology and muti-omics/system biology field.
