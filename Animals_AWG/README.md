# Animals Analysis Working Group

The Animal AWG aims to facilitate the use of omics in understanding basic mechanisms by which animals and constituent tissues and cells adapt to the spaceflight environment. Last year, this AWG also provided expertise on the adaptation of best practices for processing omics data in Genelab. To this end, the Animal AWG has contributed to the development of consensus analysis pipelines for generating higher order (processed) omics data. By making processed omics data publicly available, spaceflight omics results will be accessible to a wide range of users of varying skill levels and computational resources, thereby maximizing scientific discovery.

Current and upcoming activities are geared toward the development of manuscript(s) that demonstrate the power of omics in unraveling the mechanisms and shared molecular responses of animals during adaptation to the spaceflight environment

The Animal AWG facilitates the use of omics in understanding basic mechanisms by which animals and constituent tissues and cells adapt to the spaceflight environment.
