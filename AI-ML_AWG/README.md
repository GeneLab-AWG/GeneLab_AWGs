# AI/ML Analysis Working Group

The Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) Analysis Working Group (AWG) is intended as a forum for soliciting feedback from subject matter experts on the development of machine learning and artificial intelligence readiness of data within the [NASA Open Science Data Repositories](https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/repo/), including [GeneLab](https://genelab.nasa.gov/) and [ALSDA](https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/about/alsda.html). These efforts will maximize the use of existing data for the development of new training datasets and pre-trained models using AI/ML methodologies for the purpose of enabling new knowledge discoveries. The AWG will assess and provide feedback on the AI-readiness of data held in the Open Science Data Repositories, by iteratively conducting collaborative AI/ML analyses of the data held in these repositories.
