# GeneLab Analysis Working Groups (AWGs)

GeneLab is a science collaboration initiative that provides an open-access data system workspace with tools to analyze and visualize omics data from spaceflight. GeneLab has established the Analysis Working Groups (AWGs) with the goal of optimizing the processing of raw omics data from the GeneLab repository in order to maximize the gain of new knowledge from such rare and complex datasets. The AWGs will assess and improve the effectiveness of the GeneLab Data System (GLDS) through intensive utilization of the analytics and generate higher-order data. This GitHub repository is dedicated for AWGs members to share and collaborate their work and codes. On this repository, space biology references will also be featured for each topics to share knowledge between AWGs.
