# GeneLab Analysis Working Groups (AWGs)

GeneLab Analysis Working Groups (AWGs) are. The purpose of the AWGs is to optimize the processing of raw omics data from the GeneLab repository in order to maximize the gain of new knowledge from such complex datasets. The AWGs will also assess and improve the effectiveness of the GeneLab Data System (GLDS) through intensive utilization of the analytics to be deployed therein.

## For more information, select an AWG:
- [Animals AWG](Animals_AWG)
- [Microbes AWG](Microbes_AWG)
- [Multi-omics AWG](Multi-omics_AWG)
- [Plants AWG](Plants_AWG)
